### Dataset Organization:
In this coding competition, the dataset is organized into 10 folders, each representing a cricket team. Within each team folder, there are three subfolders for batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders. The batsmen subfolder contains Excel files with multiple sheets, each representing the dataset of an individual batsman. The columns in the batsmen dataset include:

- Match: Match number.
- Innings: Innings played.
- Date: Date of the match.
- M/Inns: Match/Innings (1st or 2nd)
- Posn: Batting position.
- Versus: Opponent team.
- Ground: Venue of the match.
- How Dismissed: Mode of dismissal.
- Runs: Runs scored.
- B/F: Balls faced.
- S/R: Strike rate.
- Aggr: Aggregate runs.
- Avg: Batting average.
- S/RC: Cumulative strike rate.

Sheet Name: `<batsman name>`

In the bowler subfolder, the dataset includes the following columns:

- Match: Match number.
- Date: Date of the match.
- M/Inns: Match/Innings (1st or 2nd)
- Versus: Opponent team.
- Ground: Venue of the match.
- Batsman Dismissed: Batsman dismissed by the bowler.
- Overs: Overs bowled.
- Wickets: Wickets taken.
- S/R: Strike rate of the bowler.
- E/R: Economy rate of the bowler.
- Wkts: Total wickets taken.
- Avg: Bowling average.

Sheet Name: `<bowler name>`

For all-rounders, there are two separate Excel files, one for batting and one for bowling. In the batting and bowling dataset, the columns are similar to the batsmen and bowlers dataset.

Sheet name: `<allrounder name> a : Batting Data`
Sheet name: `<allrounder name> b : Bowling Data`

### Problem Statement: "Who will win the 2024 Cricket Season?"
Participants are invited to employ their imagination, prediction skills, and visualization techniques with the given dataset. As you explore the intricacies of the cricket data through the questions provided, envision and predict compelling insights. Let your creativity and analytical prowess shine as you navigate through the diverse dimensions of the cricketing world encapsulated in this dataset.

1. **Innings Distribution:**
   How is the distribution of innings for players in the dataset? Are they more inclined towards top-order, middle-order, or lower-order positions?

2. **Versus Opponent Analysis:**
   Which opponent has proven to be the most challenging for the players in terms of average runs scored and strike rate?

3. **Ground Impact:**
   Does the batting performance vary significantly based on the ground? Identify grounds where players tend to perform exceptionally well or struggle.

4. **Dismissal Patterns:**

   a) Considering the ground factor
   b) Without considering the ground factor

8. **Consistency in Runs Accumulation:**
   Analyze the consistency of players in accumulating runs. Identify players with a consistent run-scoring pattern and those with more variable performances.

9. **Positional Impact on Performance:**
   How does the batting position impact the average runs scored and strike rate? Are certain positions associated with higher or lower performance?
